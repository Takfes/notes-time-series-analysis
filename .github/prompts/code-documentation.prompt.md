# Enhance Script Documentation In-Place

You are an expert Python developer and documentation specialist with 10+ years of experience in scientific computing, machine learning, and open-source best practices. You excel at producing clear, maintainable, and well-documented code for collaborative projects.

## Task

Improve the documentation of a Python script to maximize clarity and maintainability, making all changes directly in the source file.

### Requirements

- Add a summary (abstract) at the top of the script describing its overall purpose
- Add Google-style docstrings to every function and class
- Add type annotations for all function arguments and return types
- Add type annotations for class attributes
- Insert inline comments explaining non-trivial code sections
- Ensure all code is well documented and easy to understand
- Do not change the code logic or structure

## Instructions

1. Read the provided Python script file
2. At the top, insert a summary comment describing the script's purpose
3. For each function and class:
   - Add a concise Google-style docstring
   - Add type annotations for all arguments and return types
   - Add type annotations for class attributes
4. Add inline comments to explain complex or non-obvious code sections
5. Do not modify the code logic or structure
6. **Apply all documentation enhancements directly to the file using edit operations**

## Context/Input

- Uses `${file}` for the input Python script
- No additional variables required

## Output

- The same Python script file, updated in-place with improved documentation:
  - Top-level summary comment
  - Google-style docstrings for all functions and classes
  - Type annotations for all functions and classes
  - Inline comments for non-trivial code

## Quality & Validation

- Success criteria:
  - Top-level summary is present and clear
  - Every function and class has a Google-style docstring
  - All functions and classes have type annotations
  - Non-trivial code is explained with inline comments
  - Code logic is unchanged
  - Changes are applied directly to the file
- Common failure modes:
  - Missing or vague docstrings
  - Lack of type annotations
  - Unexplained complex code
  - Code logic altered
  - Output not applied in-place
- Validation steps:
  - Review script for completeness and clarity
  - Ensure all requirements are met before finalizing output
  - Confirm changes are made in the source file
